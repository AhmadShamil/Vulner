# Vulner

A project created during my cybersecurity bootcamp.
Create a bash script to automate penetration testing process.
Project goal is to assist pen-tester in carrying out the long winded process to decrease the amount of effort and time required to complete the task.

Using bash as main language for the project. Looking to upgrade to using pythin language.
Tools used to check for vulnerability mainly is nmap script engine, planning to expand more by using metasploit as an added tool.
